### Mostly Machine Learning.

#### Some things that I can do quite well but am of course still continuously learning (because each domain is very large):

|**Libraries**      ↓           |**Learning(Machine)**        |**Languages**     ↓       |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
|PyTorch                        |Vision Transformers (class..)|Python                    |
|TensorFlow                     |CNN Classification           |R                         |
|Scikit-Learn                   |CNN for restoration          |BASH                      |
|Open CV                        |Various Trad. ML Algs.       |                          |
|Pandas/Numpy                   |           (...)             |          (...)           |

Some things that I am at an earlier stage of learnind as part of continuous development and an ambition to becoming a language agnostic programmer:

|**Libraries**                  |**Learning(Machine)**        |**Languages**  ↓          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
|PyTorch3D                      | Reinforcemnt Learning       |C++                       |
|                               | Vison tranforers (seg.)     |java                      |

I also know my way around a server/unix/linux and have an interest in getting things to run on resource limited hardware.
